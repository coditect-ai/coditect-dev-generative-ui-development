**Why:** Requires nuanced understanding of context, stakeholder relationships, and long-term consequences that AI cannot fully comprehend.

**2. Ethical and Legal Approvals**
- AI model deployment approvals
- Privacy impact assessments
- Legal contract review and signing
- Regulatory compliance attestations
- Ethical review board decisions

**Why:** Human judgment on ethical implications, legal liability, and regulatory compliance cannot be delegated to AI.

**3. Security Reviews**
- Security architecture approvals
- Incident response decisions
- Access control policy changes
- Vulnerability disclosure decisions
- Third-party security assessments

**Why:** Security decisions carry existential risk and require human accountability.

**4. Data Governance**
- Data classification decisions
- Data retention policies
- Third-party data sharing approvals
