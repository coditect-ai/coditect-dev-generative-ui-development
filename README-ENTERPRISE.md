## 🏗️ Architecture

### Distributed Intelligence System

CODITECT uses a unique **symlink-based distributed intelligence architecture**:

```

## 💡 Why CODITECT?

### Traditional Development Problems

❌ **Manual orchestration overhead** - Developers spend 40-60% time on coordination
❌ **Knowledge silos** - Critical decisions lost across scattered documents
❌ **Inconsistent processes** - Every project reinvents the wheel
❌ **Context switching** - Hours lost reconstructing project state
❌ **Quality variability** - No systematic enforcement of best practices

### CODITECT Solutions

✅ **Automated orchestration** - AI agents handle coordination autonomously
✅ **Centralized intelligence** - All knowledge accessible via .coditect symlinks
✅ **Systematic processes** - Proven workflows for every project phase
✅ **Session continuity** - Context preservation across all interactions
✅ **Enforced standards** - Quality gates and compliance automation
