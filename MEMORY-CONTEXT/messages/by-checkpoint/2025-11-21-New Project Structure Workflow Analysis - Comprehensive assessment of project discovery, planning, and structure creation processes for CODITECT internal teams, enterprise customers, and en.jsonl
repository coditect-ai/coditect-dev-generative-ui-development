Now let me\n  show you the exact commands to set it up as a proper submodule:\n\n  THERE ARE 3 WAYS TO INVOKE THE SETUP, in order of preference:\n\n  ---\n  Method 1: Using the Slash Command (EASIEST)\n\n  WHY: This is the user-friendly interface designed for this exact use case.\n   It's interactive and guides you through the process.\n\n  COMMAND:\n  /setup-submodule\n\n  WHAT IT DOES:\n  - Prompts you interactively for submodule details\n  - Validates each input\n  - Creates symlinks automatically\n  - Generates templates\n  - Configures git\n  - Verifies setup\n\n  USAGE IN CLAUDE CODE:\n  Simply type /setup-submodule in Claude Code and follow the interactive\n  prompts.\n\n  ---\n  Method 2: Using the Python Script (FLEXIBLE)\n\n  WHY: Gives you full control with command-line arguments or configuration\n  files. Good for automation.\n\n  COMMAND (Interactive Mode):\n  python3 .coditect/scripts/setup-new-submodule.py --interactive\n\n  COMMAND (Direct Arguments for coditect-compliance):\n  python3 .coditect/scripts/setup-new-submodule.py \\\n    --category ops \\\n    --name coditect-compliance \\\n    --purpose \"Compliance, audit, and regulatory management system\" \\\n    --visibility public\n\n  WHAT IT DOES:\n  - Validates prerequisites (git, GitHub CLI, permissions)\n  - Creates/updates .coditect symlink \u2192 ../../../.coditect\n  - Creates/updates .claude symlink \u2192 .coditect\n  - Generates PROJECT-PLAN.md, TASKLIST.md, README.md\n  - Configures git remotes\n  - Sets up GitHub repository with topics, description, settings\n  - Verifies all symlinks work correctly\n\n  ---\n  Method 3: Using the Configuration File + Batch Script (BULK OPERATIONS)\n\n  WHY: Best for setting up multiple submodules at once. Uses declarative\n  configuration.\n\n  CONFIG FILE (config.yml):\n  submodules:\n    - category: ops\n      name: coditect-compliance\n      purpose: \"Compliance, audit, and regulatory management system\"\n      visibility: public\n\n  COMMAND:\n  python3 .coditect/scripts/batch-setup.py --config config.yml\n\n  WITH DRY-RUN (preview without making changes):\n  python3 .coditect/scripts/batch-setup.py --config config.yml --dry-run\n\n  ---\n  For coditect-compliance Specifically:\n\n  Since the folder already exists, here's the exact command:\n\n  RECOMMENDED: Interactive Script (Most Control)\n\n  python3 .coditect/scripts/setup-new-submodule.py \\\n    --category ops \\\n    --name coditect-compliance \\\n    --purpose \"Compliance, audit, and regulatory management system for \n  CODITECT platform\" \\\n    --visibility public\n\n  WHAT THIS WILL DO:\n  1. \u2705 Create .coditect symlink \u2192 ../../../.coditect (distributed\n  intelligence)\n  2. \u2705 Create .claude symlink \u2192 .coditect (Claude Code compatibility)\n  3. \u2705 Generate standardized templates:\n    - PROJECT-PLAN.md\n    - TASKLIST-WITH-CHECKBOXES.md\n    - README.md\n  4. \u2705 Configure git:\n    - Add remote origin to GitHub repo\n    - Set branch tracking\n  5. \u2705 Create/update GitHub repository (if doesn't exist)\n  6. \u2705 Run verification to confirm setup works\n  7. \u2705 Display next steps and resource links\n\n  ---\n  Exit Codes & What They Mean:\n\n  0 = Success - submodule fully configured and verified\n  1 = General error - check output for details\n  2 = Usage error - wrong arguments provided\n  3 = Prerequisites missing - install required tools\n  4 = Git operation failed - check git configuration\n  5 = GitHub operation failed - check gh CLI authentication\n\n  ---\n  Quick Reference Table:\n\n  | Use Case               | Command\n\n                      |\n  |------------------------|------------------------------------------------\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  --------------------|\n  | Interactive setup      | /setup-submodule (in Claude Code)\n\n                      |\n  | Direct setup with args | python3 \n  .coditect/scripts/setup-new-submodule.py --category ops --name\n  coditect-compliance --purpose \"Compliance system\" --visibility public |\n  | Interactive script     | python3 \n  .coditect/scripts/setup-new-submodule.py --interactive\n                                                             |\n  | Batch setup            | python3 .coditect/scripts/batch-setup.py \n  --config config.yml\n                            |\n  | Dry-run (preview)      | python3 .coditect/scripts/batch-setup.py \n  --config config.yml --dry-run\n                            |\n  | Verify after setup     | /verify-submodule (in Claude Code) or\n  ./scripts/verify-submodules.sh submodules/ops/coditect-compliance\n                               |\n  | Check health           | python3 \n  .coditect/scripts/submodule-health-check.py\n                                                             |\n\n  ---\n  Which One Should You Use?\n\n  For ONE submodule (coditect-compliance):\n  - Easiest: /setup-submodule (interactive, no args needed)\n  - Most Control: python3 .coditect/scripts/setup-new-submodule.py \n  --category ops --name coditect-compliance ...\n\n  For MULTIPLE submodules:\n  - Best: python3 .coditect/scripts/batch-setup.py --config config.yml\n\n  Would you like me to run one of these commands now?\n\n> cr most control"}, "first_seen": "2025-11-22T03:33:13.975365+00:00", "checkpoint": "2025-11-21-New Project Structure Workflow Analysis - Comprehensive assessment of project discovery, planning, and structure creation processes for CODITECT internal teams, enterprise customers, and end users"}
