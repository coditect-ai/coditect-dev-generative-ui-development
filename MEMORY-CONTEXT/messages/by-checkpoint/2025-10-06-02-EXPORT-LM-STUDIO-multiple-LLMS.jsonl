Looking at the project plan, I see that Phase 3 is marked as \"\u2705\n  COMPLETED\" but many of those tasks are actually NOT completed - they're just planned/designed.\n\n  The confusion is:\n\n  What's Actually Completed:\n  -

Phase 3.9: MVP Deployment \u2705 (just finished - Theia running)\n\n  What's NOT Actually Completed (incorrectly marked):\n  - Phase 3.1-3.6: The LLM Extension integration is only partially done\n    - The src/browser/llm-integration/ files exist\n    - But the extension is NOT loaded into Theia (we removed it from package.json to get the MVP\n  working)\n    - The LLMService, ChatWidget, etc. are implemented but not tested/integrated\n\n  The Real Status:\n  - We have a working Theia IDE MVP without LLM features\n  - The LLM extension code exists but needs to be properly built and loaded\n  - Phase 3 should be \"\ud83d\udd04 PARTIALLY COMPLETED\" not \"\u2705 COMPLETED\"\n\n  Should I update the project plan to accurately reflect what's actually working vs. what's just code\n  that exists but isn't integrated yet?\n\n> update the project plan to accurately reflect what's actually working vs. what's just code\n  that exists but isn't integrated yet \n\n\u25cf Read(project-tasks/project-plan-with-checkboxes.md)\n  \u23bf \u00a0Read 80 lines (ctrl+o to expand)\n\n\u25cf Update(project-tasks/project-plan-with-checkboxes.md)\n  \u23bf \u00a0Updated project-tasks/project-plan-with-checkboxes.md with 48 additions and 38 removals      \n        67    \n        68    ---\n        69    \n        70 -
