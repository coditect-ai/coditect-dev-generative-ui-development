⏺ I'll execute the export and deduplication workflow to prevent data loss
  before compaction.

⏺ Bash(python3 .coditect/scripts/export-dedup.py --auto-compact)
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 1

⏺ The script detected that the latest export is about 50 hours old (from Nov
   15th) and prompted for confirmation. Since this is a non-interactive
  environment, I'll bypass the prompt by running the export first as
  recommended.

  Let me run /export first to capture the current conversation state:
  ⎿  Error: Slash command export is not a prompt-based command

⏺ Let me check the available export command:

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/*export*.md")

⏺ Let me check the export-dedup command to understand the proper workflow:

⏺ Read(.coditect/commands/export-dedup.md)
  ⎿  Read 42 lines
  ⎿  .coditect/CLAUDE.md

⏺ I understand the issue. The /export command needs to be executed manually
  by you first to capture the current conversation state. The script
  requires a recent export file (less than 30 minutes old) to work properly.

  Here's what needs to happen:

  1. You need to run /export first - This captures the full conversation to
  a file
  2. Then I run the deduplication script - This processes that export file
  3. Then you can run /compact - This safely frees up space

  The workflow is designed this way because:
  - /export captures everything before compaction (prevents data loss)
  - The script deduplicates and creates a checkpoint (preserves unique
  content)
  - /compact can then safely free space (data already saved)

  Next Steps:

  Please run /export to capture the current conversation state, then I can
  proceed with the deduplication and checkpoint creation. The export command
   should appear in your command palette or you can type it directly in the
  chat.

  Once you've run /export, I'll automatically run the deduplication script
  and create the checkpoint with git commit.
