> /export-dedup is running… 

⏺ I'll execute the export deduplication script now.

⏺ Bash(python3 .coditect/scripts/export-dedup.py --yes --auto-compact)
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 1

     ============================================================
     CODITECT Export & Deduplicate Workflow
     ============================================================

     Step 1: Looking for export files...
       Searching:
         • Repo root: /Users/halcasteel/PROJECTS/coditect-rollout-master
         • MEMORY-CONTEXT: 
     /Users/halcasteel/PROJECTS/coditect-rollout-master/MEMORY-CONTEXT
     … +16 lines (ctrl+o to see all)

⏺ The export deduplication script didn't find any export files to process.
  This is expected if you haven't run /export yet in this session.

  What happened:
  - The script searched all configured locations (repo root, MEMORY-CONTEXT,
   submodules, temp directories)
  - No export files matching the pattern *EXPORT*.txt were found
  - This is normal if this is a fresh session without a prior export

  Next steps:

  If you want to create a checkpoint and preserve the current conversation
  context, you should:

  1. Run /export first to capture the current conversation
  2. Then run /export-dedup again to process it
  3. Finally run /compact to free up context space

  However, since the current conversation appears to be just starting (you
  invoked the /export-dedup command), there may not be much context to
  preserve yet.

  Would you like me to:
  1. Run /export now to capture this conversation?
  2. Skip the export and just continue with your work?
  3. Something else?
