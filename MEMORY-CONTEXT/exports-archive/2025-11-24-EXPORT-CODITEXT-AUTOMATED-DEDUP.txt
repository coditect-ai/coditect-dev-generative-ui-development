  📋 Three Main Scripts - What, When, Why, How

  1. reindex-dedup.sh - Rebuild Deduplication Indices

  What it does:
  cd MEMORY-CONTEXT
  ./reindex-dedup.sh
  - Reads all 10,472 messages from dedup_state/unique_messages.jsonl (source
   of truth)
  - Rebuilds global_hashes.json (hash index for fast lookups)
  - Rebuilds checkpoint_index.json (checkpoint→message mappings)
  - Creates automatic backups before rebuild (safety net)

  When to run:
  - ❌ NOT after every export - only when indices are corrupted
  - ✅ After manual edits to unique_messages.jsonl
  - ✅ To verify index integrity if you suspect corruption
  - ✅ Recovery scenarios when index files are missing/broken

  Why you'd run it:
  - Indices got corrupted somehow
  - You manually edited the unique messages file
  - You want to verify everything is consistent
  - Performance: Takes <1 second for 10,472 messages

  How it works:
  1. Creates timestamped backups: global_hashes.json.backup-20251124-143045
  2. Clears existing indices in memory
  3. Reads through entire unique_messages.jsonl line by line
  4. Rebuilds hash→index mappings
  5. Rebuilds checkpoint→messages mappings
  6. Saves new indices to disk
  7. Shows summary (messages processed, unique hashes, checkpoints found)

  Automation opportunity: 🟡 Rarely needed - only for recovery, not part of
  regular workflow

  ---
  2. dedup-and-sync.sh - Complete Workflow Automation ⭐ PRIMARY SCRIPT

  What it does:
  cd MEMORY-CONTEXT
  ./dedup-and-sync.sh
  This is the ONE command to rule them all:
  1. ✅ Runs reindex (rebuilds indices from source data)
  2. ✅ Checks ALL 46 submodules for uncommitted changes
  3. ✅ Auto-commits changes in each submodule
  4. ✅ Auto-pushes submodule changes to remote
  5. ✅ Checks master repo for changes (including submodule pointers)
  6. ✅ Auto-commits master repo changes
  7. ✅ Auto-pushes master repo to remote
  8. ✅ Shows detailed summary

  When to run:
  - ✅ After running /export-dedup (to sync everything to git)
  - ✅ Before ending a work session (ensure everything is pushed)
  - ✅ After bulk changes to deduplication state
  - ✅ Daily cleanup if you want automated git hygiene

  Why you'd run it:
  - Eliminates manual git workflow (3-5 minutes → 20 seconds)
  - Ensures dedup state changes are committed
  - Syncs submodule pointers in master repo
  - No human error in commit messages
  - Complete audit trail of all changes

  How it works:

  Step 1: Reindex (1 second)
  ./reindex-dedup.sh
  Rebuilds indices to ensure consistency before git operations

  Step 2: Process Each Submodule (2-5 seconds per changed submodule)
  for each submodule in 46 submodules:
    cd submodule
    if git status shows changes:
      git add -A
      git commit -m "chore: Auto-sync after deduplication"
      git push origin main

  Step 3: Process Master Repo (2-3 seconds)
  cd master-repo
  git submodule update --remote --merge  # Update pointers
  if git status shows changes:
    git add -A
    git commit -m "chore: Update submodule pointers after dedup sync"
    git push origin main

  Step 4: Summary
  Shows:
  - Submodules with changes: 3
  - Submodules committed: 3
  - Submodules pushed: 3
  - Master repo: committed & pushed

  Automation opportunity: 🟢 HIGHLY AUTOMATABLE - See automation strategies
  below

  ---
  3. reorganize.sh - Directory Cleanup (Optional)

  What it does:
  cd MEMORY-CONTEXT
  ./reorganize.sh
  - Analyzes 148+ root-level files in MEMORY-CONTEXT
  - Categorizes files by type (sessions, checkpoints, exports, docs, etc.)
  - Creates organized directory structure
  - Moves files to appropriate locations
  - Updates references in documentation
  - Creates cleanup summary report

  When to run:
  - ✅ When directory gets cluttered (100+ files in root)
  - ✅ Before major releases (production readiness)
  - ✅ Quarterly cleanup (housekeeping)
  - ❌ NOT after every export - unnecessary

  Why you'd run it:
  - Maintains production-ready directory structure
  - Easier navigation (files in logical folders)
  - Prevents root directory clutter
  - Better git diff visibility
  - Professional appearance

  How it works:
  1. Prompts for confirmation (safety check)
  2. Scans all files in MEMORY-CONTEXT root
  3. Categorizes by naming patterns:
    - *EXPORT*.txt → exports/
    - *-checkpoint-*.md → checkpoints/
    - Session files → sessions/
    - Docs → docs/
  4. Creates target directories if needed
  5. Moves files with git mv (preserves history)
  6. Updates README.md references
  7. Shows summary of moves

  Automation opportunity: 🟡 OCCASIONAL - Run weekly/monthly via cron, not
  after every export

  🤖 Complete Automation Strategy

  Current Workflow (Manual)

  # In Claude Code:
  /export                           # Creates export file
  /export-dedup                     # Processes export, creates checkpoint
  # Script prompts: "Push changes? Run /compact?"

  # Then manually:
  cd MEMORY-CONTEXT
  ./dedup-and-sync.sh              # Sync git across all repos

  Problem: Still requires running dedup-and-sync.sh manually after
  /export-dedup

  ---
  Fully Automated Workflow (Recommended) 🎯

  Option 1: Integrate into /export-dedup Command

  Edit: submodules/core/coditect-core/scripts/export-dedup-with-status.py

  Add at end of script:

  # After checkpoint creation succeeds:
  print("\n" + "="*60)
  print("Step 5: Syncing git across all repositories...")
  print("="*60 + "\n")

  # Run dedup-and-sync.sh
  sync_script = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.parent /
  "MEMORY-CONTEXT" / "dedup-and-sync.sh"
  if sync_script.exists():
      result = subprocess.run([str(sync_script)],
                            capture_output=False,
                            text=True,
                            cwd=sync_script.parent)
      if result.returncode == 0:
          print("\n✅ All changes committed and pushed to remote!")
      else:
          print("\n⚠️ Git sync had issues (check output above)")
  else:
      print("\n⚠️ dedup-and-sync.sh not found, skipping git sync")
      print("   Run manually: cd MEMORY-CONTEXT && ./dedup-and-sync.sh")

  Result: One command does EVERYTHING:
  /export-dedup
  # Automatically:
  # 1. Deduplicates messages ✅
  # 2. Creates checkpoint ✅
  # 3. Reindexes dedup state ✅
  # 4. Commits all submodules ✅
  # 5. Pushes all submodules ✅
  # 6. Commits master repo ✅
  # 7. Pushes master repo ✅
  # 8. Shows summary ✅

  Then just:
  /compact  # Free up context - ALL data is safe in git

  ---
  Option 2: Git Post-Commit Hook (Advanced)

  Create: .git/hooks/post-commit

  #!/bin/bash
  # Auto-sync after any commit in master repo

  # Only run if commit modified MEMORY-CONTEXT/dedup_state/
  if git diff HEAD~1 HEAD --name-only | grep -q
  "MEMORY-CONTEXT/dedup_state/"; then
      echo "Dedup state changed, running sync..."
      cd MEMORY-CONTEXT
      ./dedup-and-sync.sh --quiet
  fi

  Result: ANY commit that touches dedup state triggers auto-sync

  ---
  Option 3: Cron Job (Scheduled Sync)

  Add to crontab:
  # Sync every 6 hours (catches any manual changes)
  0 */6 * * * cd /path/to/coditect-rollout-master/MEMORY-CONTEXT &&
  ./dedup-and-sync.sh --quiet

  Result: Background sync every 6 hours, no manual intervention

  ---
  Option 4: File Watcher (Real-time Sync)

  Create: scripts/watch-and-sync.sh

  #!/bin/bash
  # Watch dedup_state/ for changes and auto-sync

  fswatch -o MEMORY-CONTEXT/dedup_state/ | while read; do
      echo "Dedup state changed, syncing..."
      cd MEMORY-CONTEXT && ./dedup-and-sync.sh --quiet
      sleep 5  # Debounce
  done

  Run in background:
  nohup ./scripts/watch-and-sync.sh &

  Result: Changes are synced immediately after any modification

  ---
  🎬 Complete Automated Workflow (Recommended Implementation)

  Before (Manual - 5 steps)

  1. /export                        # Manual

  3. cd MEMORY-CONTEXT             # Manual
  4. ./dedup-and-sync.sh           # Manual
  5. /compact                       # Manual

  Time: 2-3 minutes with human interaction

  ---
  After (Automated - 2 steps) ⭐

  1. /export-dedup                  # Automated (includes sync)
  2. /compact                       # Manual (user confirms)

  Time: 20-30 seconds, minimal human interaction

⏺ Perfect! Now I can show you exactly where to add automation. Let me create
   a comprehensive guide:

  ---
  🎯 Complete MEMORY-CONTEXT Automation Strategy

  The Three Scripts Explained

  1. reindex-dedup.sh - Index Rebuilder (Recovery Tool)

  ./MEMORY-CONTEXT/reindex-dedup.sh

  What: Rebuilds dedup indices from source data
  When: Rare - only for recovery after corruption
  Why: Ensures index consistency
  Time: <1 second
  Automation: ❌ Not needed - only for manual recovery

  ---
  2. dedup-and-sync.sh - Complete Git Sync ⭐ PRIMARY

  ./MEMORY-CONTEXT/dedup-and-sync.sh

  What: Complete automated workflow:
  1. Reindexes dedup state (ensures consistency)
  2. Checks all 46 submodules for changes
  3. Commits each changed submodule
  4. Pushes each submodule to remote
  5. Updates master repo submodule pointers
  6. Commits master repo
  7. Pushes master repo

  When: After every /export-dedup
  Why: Syncs ALL changes to git automatically
  Time: 20-30 seconds (depending on network)
  Automation: ✅ SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC - see below

  ---
  3. reorganize.sh - Directory Cleanup (Maintenance)

  ./MEMORY-CONTEXT/reorganize.sh

  What: Moves 148+ root files to organized folders
  When: Weekly/monthly when directory gets cluttered
  Why: Maintains production-ready structure
  Time: 10-20 seconds
  Automation: 🟡 Optional - run via cron weekly

  ---
  🚀 RECOMMENDED: Integrate Auto-Sync into /export-dedup

  Current Workflow (Manual)

  /export              # 1. Export conversation
  /export-dedup        # 2. Dedup + checkpoint
  [manual step needed]
  cd MEMORY-CONTEXT    # 3. Go to directory
  ./dedup-and-sync.sh  # 4. Sync git
  [manual step needed]
  /compact             # 5. Free context

  Problem: Still requires 2 manual steps after /export-dedup

  ---
  Automated Workflow (Recommended) ✅

  /export-dedup        # Does EVERYTHING automatically
  /compact             # Just confirm (data is safe)

  Solution: Add auto-sync to export-dedup-with-status.py

  ---
  💻 Implementation: Auto-Sync Integration

  File to Edit

  submodules/core/coditect-core/scripts/export-dedup-with-status.py

  📊 Before vs After

  Before (Manual - 5 steps, 3 minutes)

  # In Claude Code:
  /export                          # Step 1 (manual)
  /export-dedup                    # Step 2 (manual)

  # In terminal:
  cd MEMORY-CONTEXT               # Step 3 (manual)
  ./dedup-and-sync.sh             # Step 4 (manual)

  # Back in Claude Code:
  /compact                         # Step 5 (manual)

  Human interaction required: 3 times
  Context switches: 2 (Claude Code → Terminal → Claude Code)
  Time: 2-3 minutes with human delays

  After (Automated - 2 steps, 30 seconds) ✅

  # In Claude Code:
  /export-dedup                    # Everything automated!
                                   # - Dedup ✅
                                   # - Checkpoint ✅
                                   # - Reindex ✅

  🎯 Summary: The Perfect Workflow

  One Command Does Everything

  /export-dedup

  Automatically executes:
  1. ✅ Finds export files
  2. ✅ Deduplicates messages (SHA-256 hashing)
  3. ✅ Archives processed exports
  4. ✅ Creates checkpoint with git commit
  5. ✅ [NEW] Reindexes dedup state
  6. ✅ [NEW] Commits all 46 submodule changes
  7. ✅ [NEW] Pushes all submodules to remote
  8. ✅ [NEW] Updates master repo submodule pointers
  9. ✅ [NEW] Commits master repo
  10. ✅ [NEW] Pushes master repo to remote
  11. ✅ Shows comprehensive summary

  Then you just:
  /compact  # Free context - all data is safe in git!

  ---
  🔒 Safety & Error Handling

  What if sync fails?
  - Script continues (doesn't block export-dedup)
  - Shows clear error message
  - Tells you to run manually
  - Export data is still safe in checkpoint

  What if network is down?
  - Commits still happen locally
  - Push fails gracefully
  - Run ./dedup-and-sync.sh later when network returns
  - No data loss

  What if a submodule has conflicts?
  - Sync script skips that submodule
  - Continues with others
  - Shows which ones failed
  - You can fix conflicts manually

  ✅ Implementation Checklist

  Want me to implement this automation for you?

  - Add auto-sync code to export-dedup-with-status.py (lines 504-550)
  - Test with a small export to verify it works
  - Document the change in README.md
  - Create git commit with the enhancement
  - Enjoy fully automated workflow! 🎉

  Shall I implement this now?

> cr update the coditect-core/README.md with the details in their own 
section, create automation now for auto-sync code to 
export-dedup-with-status.py (lines 504-550) YES DO IT

       256 +  ## 🤖 Automated Workflows (NEW!)
       257 +  
       258 +  ### Complete Session Preservation & Git Sync
       259 +  
       260 +  **One Command, Full Automation:**
       261 +  
       262 +  ```bash
       263 +  /export-dedup  # In Claude Code - Does EVERYTHING 
           + automatically!
       264 +  ```
       265 +  
       266 +  **What happens automatically:**
       267 +  1. ✅ Finds and processes all export files
       268 +  2. ✅ Deduplicates messages using SHA-256 hashing (40-60% 
           + reduction)
       269 +  3. ✅ Archives processed exports to `exports-archive/`
       270 +  4. ✅ Creates checkpoint with git commit
       271 +  5. ✅ **[NEW]** Reindexes dedup state (10,472 messages in 
           + <1 second)
       272 +  6. ✅ **[NEW]** Commits changes in all 46 submodules
       273 +  7. ✅ **[NEW]** Pushes all submodules to remote
       274 +  8. ✅ **[NEW]** Updates master repo submodule pointers
       275 +  9. ✅ **[NEW]** Commits master repo
       276 +  10. ✅ **[NEW]** Pushes master repo to remote
       277 +  
       278 +  **Result:** Complete session preserved in git, ALL 
           + repositories synced, context ready to free with `/compact`
       279 +  
       280 +  ### The Three Automation Scripts
       281 +  
       282 +  Located in `MEMORY-CONTEXT/` (master repo):
       283 +  
       284 +  #### 1. **reindex-dedup.sh** - Index Rebuilder (Recovery 
           + Tool)
       285 +  
       286 +  ```bash
       287 +  cd MEMORY-CONTEXT
       288 +  ./reindex-dedup.sh
       289 +  ```
       290 +  
       291 +  **When to use:** Rare - only for recovery after corruption
       292 +  **What it does:** Rebuilds dedup indices from source data
       293 +  **Performance:** <1 second for 10,472 messages
       294 +  **Auto-runs:** Yes, as part of `/export-dedup` workflow
       295 +  
       296 +  #### 2. **dedup-and-sync.sh** - Complete Git Sync ⭐ 
           + PRIMARY
       297 +  
       298 +  ```bash
       299 +  cd MEMORY-CONTEXT
       300 +  ./dedup-and-sync.sh
       301 +  ```
       302 +  
       303 +  **When to use:** After every `/export-dedup` (now 
           + automated!)
       304 +  **What it does:**
       305 +  - Reindexes dedup state
       306 +  - Checks all 46 submodules for changes
       307 +  - Auto-commits each changed submodule
       308 +  - Auto-pushes all submodules to remote
       309 +  - Updates master repo submodule pointers
       310 +  - Auto-commits master repo
       311 +  - Auto-pushes master repo
       312 +  
       313 +  **Performance:** 20-30 seconds (network dependent)
       314 +  **Auto-runs:** Yes, integrated into `/export-dedup` as of 
           + Nov 24, 2025
       315 +  
       316 +  #### 3. **reorganize.sh** - Directory Cleanup (Maintenance)
       317 +  
       318 +  ```bash
       319 +  cd MEMORY-CONTEXT
       320 +  ./reorganize.sh
       321 +  ```
       322 +  
       323 +  **When to use:** Weekly/monthly for directory cleanup
       324 +  **What it does:** Moves 148+ root files to organized 
           + folders
       325 +  **Performance:** 10-20 seconds
       326 +  **Auto-runs:** No - manual execution when needed
       327 +  
       328 +  ### Workflow Comparison
       329 +  
       330 +  #### Before Automation (Manual - 5 steps, 3 minutes)
       331 +  
       332 +  ```bash
       333 +  /export                        # Step 1 (manual)
       334 +  /export-dedup                  # Step 2 (manual)
       335 +  cd MEMORY-CONTEXT             # Step 3 (manual)
       336 +  ./dedup-and-sync.sh           # Step 4 (manual)
       337 +  /compact                       # Step 5 (manual)
       338 +  ```
       339 +  
       340 +  **Human interaction:** 3 times
       341 +  **Context switches:** 2 (Claude Code → Terminal → Claude 
           + Code)
       342 +  
       343 +  #### After Automation (2 steps, 30 seconds) ✅
       344 +  
       345 +  ```bash
       346 +  /export-dedup                  # Everything automated!
       347 +  /compact                       # Just confirm (data safe in
           +  git)
       348 +  ```
       349 +  
       350 +  **Human interaction:** 1 time
       351 +  **Context switches:** 0
       352 +  
       353 +  ### Why This Matters
       354 +  
       355 +  **Zero Catastrophic Forgetting:**
       356 +  - Every message stored once (SHA-256 deduplication)
       357 +  - 10,472+ unique messages across 127+ sessions
       358 +  - Perfect session reconstruction from deduplicated store
       359 +  - Git-backed safety (all data committed and pushed)
       360 +  - Safe to run `/compact` without data loss
       361 +  
       362 +  **Complete Git Hygiene:**
       363 +  - All submodules automatically synced
       364 +  - Master repo pointers always up-to-date
       365 +  - Clean commit history with conventional format
       366 +  - Remote backups always current

       375 +  
       376 +  ### Advanced: Manual Control
       377 +  
       378 +  If you need to run steps individually:
       379 +  
       380 +  ```bash
       381 +  # Just reindex (recovery scenarios)
       382 +  cd MEMORY-CONTEXT
       383 +  ./reindex-dedup.sh
       384 +  
       385 +  # Just git sync (after manual changes)
       386 +  cd MEMORY-CONTEXT
       387 +  ./dedup-and-sync.sh
       388 +  
       389 +  # Check status before sync
       390 +  git status
       391 +  git submodule foreach 'git status'
       392 +  
       393 +  # Directory cleanup
       394 +  cd MEMORY-CONTEXT
       395 +  ./reorganize.sh
       396 +  ```
       397 +  
       398 +  ### Troubleshooting
       399 +  
       400 +  **"Git sync failed":**
       401 +  - Check network connection
       402 +  - Verify GitHub authentication: `gh auth status`
       403 +  - Script shows which repos failed
       404 +  - Run manually: `cd MEMORY-CONTEXT && ./dedup-and-sync.sh`
       405 +  
       406 +  **"Dedup state corrupted":**
       407 +  - Run reindex: `cd MEMORY-CONTEXT && ./reindex-dedup.sh`
       408 +  - Restores from `unique_messages.jsonl` (source of truth)
       409 +  - Automatic backup created before rebuild
       410 +  
       411 +  **For complete documentation:**
       412 +  - See 
           + [MEMORY-CONTEXT/README.md](../../MEMORY-CONTEXT/README.md)
