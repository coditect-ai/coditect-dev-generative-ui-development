● I've successfully completed ADR-025-v4 Migration Strategy Architecture:

  Part 1 (Narrative) covers:
  - Zero-downtime migration strategies
  - Multiple migration patterns (Parallel Run, Gradual Cutover, Big Bang, Hybrid Cloud)
  - Bridge construction analogy for explaining continuous operation
  - Real-world FinanceCorpExample migration scenario
  - Comprehensive risk mitigation strategies

  Part 2 (Technical) provides:
  - Concise implementation with MigrationOrchestrator
  - CDC (Change Data Capture) implementation patterns
  - Traffic routing with percentage-based distribution
  - Data validation with checksum verification
  - Instant rollback capabilities (<60 seconds)
  - Complete API specifications for migration control

  Both parts have been created and I've requested QA review. I'm now ready for my next assignment.

● I understand you want to export the conversation. You can use the /export command in Claude Code to save this conversation. Based on your
  filename pattern, you would use:

  /export 2025-09-01-EXPORT-ADRS-session5.txt

  The export watcher system will automatically detect and archive the exported file to .session/conversations/ with proper organization.
