  ---
  Key Architectural Insights

  The document advocates for a microservices architecture with:

  1. Independent Applications:
    - CRM and Booking as separate bounded contexts
    - Event-driven integration (not tight coupling)
    - Customers can license one or both
  2. Integration Pattern:
  Shared kernel:
    - Identity service (single customer ID)
    - Event bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
    - API contracts

  Integration adapters:
    - CRM subscribes to booking events
    - Booking publishes events (no CRM dependency)
  3. Deployment Flexibility:
    - CRM-only customers
    - Booking-only customers
    - Full suite customers
    - Feature flags per tenant

  ---
  Prompt Framework Format

  Each prompt follows a consistent structure:

  Role: "You are a [domain expert]..."
  Context: "Business context and scope..."
  Output: JSON specification with structured fields
  Requirements: Detailed questions to explore
  Examples: YAML/Python code examples

  Output format: All prompts request JSON-structured responses for
  systematic documentation.

  ---
  Technical Sophistication

  The document demonstrates enterprise-grade thinking:

  - Event-driven architecture (webhooks, pub/sub)
  - Multi-tenancy considerations
  - Data governance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)
  - API-first design (REST, GraphQL, webhooks)
  - Scalability patterns (async processing, caching)
  - Advanced analytics (forecasting, ML scoring)
  - Modern tech stack (shown in code examples)

  ---
  Business Model Coverage

  - Pricing strategies: Per-user, per-feature, tiered
  - Customer segments: SMB, mid-market, enterprise
  - Deployment models: Cloud, on-prem, hybrid
  - Tenancy: Single-tenant vs. multi-tenant
  - Regulatory compliance: Industry-specific requirements

  ---
  Use Cases Addressed

  CRM scenarios:
  - B2B sales (complex pipelines)
  - B2C sales (high-volume)
  - Channel/partner sales
  - Customer success post-sale
  - Marketing automation

  Booking scenarios:
  - Appointment scheduling
  - Resource booking
  - Meeting coordination
  - Calendar integration
  - Self-service booking portals

  Integration scenarios:
  - Demo booking → auto-create opportunity
  - Lead books meeting → convert to SQL
  - Opportunity stage → trigger booking workflow
  - Unified customer activity timeline

  ---
  Estimated Execution

  According to the document:
  - Total prompts: 33
  - Estimated time: 40-60 hours for comprehensive discovery
  - Execution strategy: Sequential phases recommended

  ---
  Document Quality

  Strengths:

  ---
  Recommended Next Steps

  If you're building a CRM/Booking platform, this document provides:

  1. Requirements gathering framework - Execute prompts sequentially
  2. Architectural blueprint - Event-driven, microservices approach
  3. Integration patterns - Loose coupling via events
  4. Technical specifications - Ready for SDD/PRD creation

  Would you like me to:
  1. Extract specific sections (e.g., just Booking requirements)?
  2. Generate JSON outputs for specific prompts?
  3. Create an execution plan for running these prompts?
  4. Analyze integration architecture in detail?
  5. Compare against Odoo CRM capabilities?

> shall we extract the prompts or keep theem as one? 

⏺ I'd recommend extracting them into separate files. Here's why:

  Pros of Extraction:

  1. Execution-friendly - You hit the 256KB limit just now; individual
  prompts are easier to work with
  2. Track progress - Can mark which prompts you've completed
  3. Store responses - Keep JSON outputs alongside each prompt
  4. Reusability - Use specific prompts independently
  5. Version control - See changes to individual prompts
  6. Collaboration - Team members can work on different prompts
  simultaneously

  Suggested Structure:

  docs/research/CRM/
  ├── prompts/
  │   ├── phase-1-foundation/
  │   │   ├── 1.1-business-model-discovery.md
  │   │   ├── 1.2-user-personas.md
  │   │   └── 1.3-core-domain-model.md
  │   ├── phase-2-crm/
  │   │   ├── 2.1-contact-management.md
  │   │   ├── 2.2-sales-pipeline.md
  │   │   └── ... (27 prompts)
  │   ├── phase-3-booking/
  │   ├── phase-4-integration/
  │   └── phase-5-cross-cutting/
  ├── responses/
  │   └── (JSON outputs from executing prompts)
  ├── README.md (index of all prompts)
  └── crm-prompts-research.txt (original)

  Alternative: Keep as One + Create Index

  If you prefer one file, I can create:
  - Quick reference index with line numbers
  - Extraction script to pull specific prompts on demand

  What's your goal? Are you planning to:
  - Execute these prompts systematically?
  - Use as reference documentation?
  - Build requirements from them?

  That'll help me recommend the best approach.

> do the prompts have clear boundaries? 

⏺ Let me check the prompt boundaries in the document:

⏺ Search(pattern: "^(### Prompt|^Prompt [0-9]|^##)", path:
        "crm-prompts-research.txt", output_mode: "content", head_limit: 100)
  ⎿  Found 48 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Read(crm-prompts-research.txt)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

⏺ Read(crm-prompts-research.txt)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines

⏺ Bash(grep -n "^Prompt\|^### Prompt\|^Define YOUR\|^Specify" /Users/halcasteel/
      PROJECTS/ERP-ODOO-FORK/docs/research/CRM/crm-prompts-research.txt | tail
      -20)
  ⎿ 8193:Prompt 2.21: Mobile CRM & Field Sales                             
    8533:Define YOUR field sales requirements - do reps work mostly offline
     or online?
    … +26 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


⏺ YES - the prompts have clear boundaries!

  Pattern Found:

  Each prompt ends with:
  - Define YOUR [specific aspect] - [question]?
  - Specify which [requirements]...
  - Be specific about [details]...

  Next prompt starts with:
  - Prompt X.Y: Title (with or without ### prefix)

  Example Boundaries:

  ... [Prompt 2.5 content] ...
  Be specific about which sources generate highest-quality leads vs. highest
   volume.
  Prompt 2.6: Lead Scoring & Qualification
  You are a sales operations analyst...

  ... [Prompt 2.29 content] ...
  Define YOUR win/loss analysis frequency - every deal or sample?
  Prompt 2.30: System Administration, Governance & Change Management
  You are a CRM administrator...

  Formatting Inconsistency:

  - Phase 1-5 headers: Use ### Prompt X.Y:
  - Phase 2 extended prompts: Use Prompt X.Y: (no ###)

  But this doesn't affect extractability - the pattern is consistent.

  Extraction is Feasible:

  I can write a script to:
  1. Split on ^Prompt \d+\.\d+: regex
  2. Each prompt is self-contained
  3. Preserve all content between prompts

  Want me to extract them into individual files? It'll take ~5 minutes to
  script and execute.

  # Navigate to prompts directory
  cd docs/research/CRM/prompts

  # Read the index
  cat README.md

  # Start with Phase 1
  cat phase-1-foundation/1.1-business-model-discovery.md

  # Store responses in responses/ directory as JSON files

  ---
  Next steps:

  1. Execute prompts sequentially (Phase 1 first - it's foundational)
  2. Store JSON outputs in responses/ directory
  3. Track progress using the checklist in responses/README.md
  4. Use outputs to build Software Design Documents (SDDs)

  ---
  Files you can delete now:

  - split_prompts.py (extraction script - no longer needed)
  - crm-prompts-research.txt (original - keep as backup if you want)

  Want me to help you execute the first prompt (Business Model Discovery) or
   create a tracking system for managing prompt completion?

  - Total Time: 2-3 hours (started at 5:04 AM, finish ~7-8 AM)
  - Cost: ~$50-100 total

  🔍 Monitor Progress:

  # Check status anytime
  python3 execute_prompts.py --status

  # Watch live execution
  tail -f execution.log

  ls -lh prompts/responses/

  # Preview a response
  cat prompts/responses/1.1-business-model-discovery.json | jq .

  🎯 What's Happening Now:

  The orchestrator is autonomously:
  1. Reading each prompt file
  2. Sending to Claude Sonnet 4 via API
  3. Parsing JSON responses
  4. Validating structure
  5. Saving to prompts/responses/
  6. Tracking progress
  7. Moving to next prompt

  📑 Final Deliverables (Auto-generated when complete):

  - CRM-REQUIREMENTS-COMPREHENSIVE.md - Complete requirements document
  - CRM-REQUIREMENTS-COMPREHENSIVE.json - Structured JSON export
  - 43 individual JSON files with detailed requirements

  ---
  You can safely close this session - the process runs in background. Come
  back in 2-3 hours to a complete requirements document! 🚀

> cr so many prompts hwo to best organize the data, do we have a good handle
 on that? call ORCHESTRATOR and project-organizer agent and any others as 
necessary to choose the appropriate multi-agent to manage, so this work can 
progress rapidly without bottlenecks as it evolves add agents keep the 
project clean and organized. regular CHECKPOINTS and git add commit pushes 
frequently in the master project relevant submodule. stay organized and keep
 the submodule directory clean and organized for production build process 

⏺ Excellent strategic thinking! Let me bring in the orchestrator to
  coordinate with project-organizer and other agents to establish a
  production-ready, scalable organization system with automated checkpoints
  and git workflow:
