⏺ I'll continue from where we left off - implementing the hybrid approach.
  Let me first check the current state of the checkpoint script and then
  commit the changes.

⏺ Now let me test the hybrid checkpoint creation to verify it works
  correctly:

⏺ Excellent! The hybrid context preservation implementation is working
  perfectly. Let me summarize what we've accomplished:

  ✅ Session Complete - All Objectives Achieved

  1. Training Materials Enhanced ✅

  Updated all CODITECT training documents with comprehensive checkpoint and
  command router documentation:

  - 1-2-3-ONBOARDING-HOWTO-QUICK-GUIDE.md - Added checkpoint section with
  examples
  - user-training/README.md - Added Essential Tools section (AI Command
  Router + Checkpoints)
  - user-training/CLAUDE.md - Added training delivery guidance for AI
  assistants
  - 1-2-3-CODITECT-ONBOARDING-GUIDE.md - Added comprehensive AI Command
  Router and checkpoint sections

  2. Hybrid Context Preservation ✅

  Implemented automatic + manual context preservation system:

  Automated Extraction (Step 3.5):
  - ✅ Git state (commits, branches, file changes)
  - ✅ Completed tasks from TASKLISTs
  - ✅ Checkpoint sections and metadata
  - ✅ JSON export for programmatic access
  - ✅ Tracked 33 file changes in this session

  Manual Export Prompt:
  - ✅ Prepares export location
  - ✅ Non-blocking workflow
  - ✅ Prompts for /export to capture full conversation

  3. Git Commits & Pushes ✅

  - Submodule: fddc86f - Hybrid context preservation implementation
  - Parent: 2115fa5 - Updated framework submodule pointer
  - Checkpoint: 2025-11-16T19-53-41Z - Auto-committed and pushed

  4. Verified Working ✅

  Successfully tested the hybrid checkpoint creation - all features working:
  - Automatic context extraction via session_export.py
  - Non-blocking export preparation
  - Auto-commit and auto-push to remote
  - Complete documentation updates

  📤 Final Step: Complete Conversation Export

  To achieve ZERO catastrophic forgetting, run this command to save the full
   conversation:

  /export

  Save to:
  /Users/halcasteel/PROJECTS/coditect-rollout-master/.coditect/MEMORY-CONTEX
  T/exports/2025-11-16T19-53-41Z-Hybrid-Context-Preservation-Implementation-
  and-Training-Materials-Complete.txt

  This ensures complete context preservation:
  - ✅ Checkpoint = Project state (WHAT was done)
  - ✅ Automated extraction = Context (git, tasks, sections)
  - ✅ /export = Full conversation (WHY and HOW decisions were made)

> /export /Users/halcasteel/PROJECTS/coditect-rollout-master/.coditect/MEMORY-CO
NTEXT/exports/2025-11-16T19-53-41

  ⎿ Failed to export conversation: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Use

    te.txt'

> /code_explain is running… 

⏺ I see you tried to run the /export command but encountered a path error.
  The issue is that the export path is being treated as relative when it
  should be absolute. Let me help you export the conversation correctly.

  The correct path for the export is:

  /Users/halcasteel/PROJECTS/coditect-rollout-master/.coditect/MEMORY-CONTEX
  T/exports/2025-11-16T19-53-41Z-Hybrid-Context-Preservation-Implementation-
  and-Training-Materials-Complete.txt

  However, I notice the error shows it's trying to prepend the working
  directory to the path. Let me run the export command with the correct
  relative path from your current working directory:

  /export

  And save to:

  .coditect/MEMORY-CONTEXT/exports/2025-11-16T19-53-41Z-Hybrid-Context-Prese
  rvation-Implementation-and-Training-Materials-Complete.txt

  This should work correctly since you're already in the
  /Users/halcasteel/PROJECTS/coditect-rollout-master/ directory.

  Summary of This Session:

  ✅ All Training Materials Updated - Comprehensive documentation for
  checkpoint system and AI command router
  ✅ Hybrid Context Preservation Implemented - Automatic extraction + manual
   /export prompt
  ✅ Non-Blocking Workflow - Works perfectly with bash automation
  ✅ Git Commits Completed - All changes committed and pushed to remote
  ✅ Checkpoint Created - Full project state captured

  📤 Final Action Needed: Run /export with the relative path above to
  capture full conversation context for zero catastrophic forgetting.
