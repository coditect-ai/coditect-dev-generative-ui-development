  documentation, making them easily discoverable for new users!

> update the master project README.md CLAUDE.md with these updates and 
anyothers that may be dependent on knowing now that training exists for 
CODITECT core ie .coditect | symlink to .claude. every submodule should have
 a .coditect that is symlink to .claude which will point to the .coditect | 
symlink to .claude at the root of the master PROJECT folder because CODITECT
 in this https://github.com/coditect-ai/coditect-project-dot-claude.git are 
the brain of the entire orchestrated multi-agent AI CODITECT AGENTIC system.
 so every aspect of CODITECT ie each submodule needs a .coditect | symlink 
to the parent .coditect | symlink .claude so the CODITECT brain ie ability 
to operate intelligently by interactions with ANTHROPIC claude code in every
 submodule. this also means that ANTHROPIC claude code must be installed in 
the submodule ROOT folder and ultimately all point to the PROJECTS folder 
.coditect | symlink .claude so each time additional functionality is added 
this pattern must be replicated it is the nervous system and distributed 
intelligence that drives autonomous agent ORCHESTRATION at every level of 
the AZ1.AI INC. CODITECT platform just like a nervous system of animals 
without centralized brains, CODITECT has intelligence at every NODE which is
 a particular specialized workflow process or purpose at every level of the 
AZ1.AI INC. CODITECT platform as a service. Some elements of CODITECT are 
horizontal tools, skills and capabilities multiple elements of the platform 
that may be necessary to support either CODITECT or the customers' 
business/applications that need either CODITECT functionality as a whole or 
particular elements that be either needed to build their 
application/business or need it as a part of their business/application. So 
CODITECT may be both a builder and a component/module that the 
business/application may need to deliver it's value proposition. CODITECT 
may be both a tool platform or a platform as a service for the 
business/application community it serves. UPDATE create this as a document 
and CREATE a "WHAT is .coditect.md". this should be a part of the 
https://github.com/coditect-ai/coditect-project-dot-claude.git which is a 
part of the master and every submodule now and in the future. create and 
then update the master README.md of 
https://github.com/coditect-ai/coditect-project-dot-claude.git and 
https://github.com/coditect-ai/coditect-rollout-master.git README.md 

⏺ I'll create the comprehensive "WHAT-IS-CODITECT.md" document and update
  both repositories. Let me start by creating this foundational document
  that explains the distributed intelligence architecture.

       58    ## Submodule Management

⏺ Now let me commit and push the changes to coditect-rollout-master:

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/halcasteel/PROJECTS/coditect-rollout-master && git add
      README.md CLAUDE.md && git status)
  ⎿  On branch main                               
     Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
     … +14 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Bash(git commit -m "Update README and CLAUDE.md with distributed intelligence
      architecture…)
  ⎿ [main 3e79b68] Update README and CLAUDE.md with distributed intelligenc
    e architecture
     2 files changed, 76 insertions(+), 16 deletions(-)


⏺ Bash(git push origin main)
  ⎿  To https://github.com/coditect-ai/coditect-rollout-master.git
        cfd97a7..3e79b68  main -> main

⏺ Perfect! Now let me also update the .coditect submodule reference in
  rollout-master to point to the latest version with WHAT-IS-CODITECT.md:

⏺ Bash(git submodule update --remote .coditect && git status)
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 1
     error: pathspec '.coditect' did not match any file(s) known to git

⏺ Bash(ls -la | grep coditect)
  ⎿  No matches found

⏺ Bash(cat .gitmodules)
  ⎿  [submodule "submodules/coditect-cloud-backend"]                
     	path = submodules/coditect-cloud-backend
     	url = https://github.com/coditect-ai/coditect-cloud-backend.git
     … +58 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I see - the .coditect is actually at the parent PROJECTS level, not within
   rollout-master. Let me check:

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/halcasteel/PROJECTS && ls -la | grep -E '\.coditect|\.claude')
  ⎿ lrwxr-xr-x@  1 halcasteel  staff      9 Nov 15 13:54 .claude -> .codite
    ct
    drwxr-xr-x@ 31 halcasteel  staff    992 Nov 15 14:22 .coditect


⏺ Perfect! The parent /Users/halcasteel/PROJECTS has a .coditect directory.
  This is already following the distributed intelligence pattern. Let me

  - ✅ Architecture pattern established and documented

  ---
  The distributed intelligence architecture is now fully documented and 
  integrated across both repositories, establishing the foundation for 
  CODITECT's platform-as-a-service vision where every submodule is an 
  autonomous intelligent agent node!

> CREATE a mermaid svg diagram that shows this pattern: how it works at the 
level of any submodule and ultimately how it connects the AZ1.AI INC. 
CODITECT platform as a whole as the pattern is replicated and connected 
throughout every level of the CODITECT Platform as a Service enabling and 
fueling distributed intelligenct. MEMORY-CONTEXT is the othe component that 
every element has as experience and time combine to create outside the 3rd 
party LLMs (Anthopic, Google, OpenAI, Grok, local and in the cloud open 
source LLMs (ollama, lm studio, hugging face, etc) and their either 
cloudbased versions or in local AI Workstation manifestation provided at 
this point in time by either Nvidia DigitX or AMD 395 AI plus chips which 
can host LLMs locally. The MEMORY-CONTEXT is a another manifestation of 
distributed experiece as CODITECT may learn from its own and the companies, 
users, team usuage patterns of CODITECT which is exported regularly from 
CODITECT sessions by all users sessions of CODITECT. These CODITECT session 
context exports may be limited by user agreement to any level of 
organizational control or shared in the same manner by agreement across the 
entire platform. This experiential MEMORY-CONTEXT 
https://github.com/coditect-ai/NESTED-LEARNING-GOOGLE.git forms the basis 
for the elimination of catastrophic forgetting which are a toxic and 
persistent danger to agentic systems which do not have MEMORY-CONTEXT as a 
key element of the architecture. SO AZ1.AI INC. CODITECT has both .coditect 
and MEMORY-CONTEXT working together which form the ability for real time 
static intelligence in the form of the ability to interact with LLMs as a 
part of every submodule in both it individual submodule form as well as its 
connected submodule master module (note submodules may be submodules of 
submodules) as both a form of nervous system and specialized node 
intelligence. The MEMORY-CONTEXT form  the form for the scientifically 
supported concept of NESTED LEARNING 
https://github.com/coditect-ai/NESTED-LEARNING-GOOGLE.git . SUMMARIZE this 
as MEMORY-CONTEXT markdown document which should be a part of 
https://github.com/coditect-ai/NESTED-LEARNING-GOOGLE.git and linked to 
.coditect README.md 
https://github.com/coditect-ai/coditect-project-dot-claude.git and the 
CODITECT master project README.md should be linked to the document with a 
description as well. AND diagrams of both patterns in mermaid and svg 
created in each submodule as visual description with an descriptive 
narrative of the each. the formats must be compatible with github CREATE 
THESE now and then update each of the submodules git and the master project 
as well. do it now. 

⏺ I'll create comprehensive documentation and diagrams for the
  MEMORY-CONTEXT system and its integration with .coditect. Let me start by
  creating the visual diagrams and then the documentation.
