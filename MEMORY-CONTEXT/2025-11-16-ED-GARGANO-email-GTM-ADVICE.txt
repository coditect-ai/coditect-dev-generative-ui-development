Hey Hal, very happy we finalized the advisor’s agreement, and I want to say again how thrilled I am to join the team. I’ve been thinking about our last conversation and wanted to share a few ideas that could really help you stand out as you move toward fundraising.

You’re already doing so many of the right things, tightening up your deck and one-pager, talking to prospects, getting strong feedback, building your team and building something people actually want. What I’m offering below isn’t meant as criticism; it’s the kind of polish that most founders never even think about, and that’s exactly why it gives you an edge and is one of the core components stressed to all the companies I mentor at The Runway.

Here are a few strategic moves that can help you look unusually buttoned-up, well beyond the typical pre-revenue startup:

1.     Tighten your prospect engagement tracking. You’re already getting great conversations, now turn that into a simple, visible system. A visual guide of buyer interest, a ranking of who’s close, even a light CRM summary. Investors love seeing momentum they can quantify even without revenue.

2.     Build a commitment pipeline. This is gold. Capture letters of intent, “we would buy this if…” statements, or even simple emails from prospects confirming their interest. These carry weight far more than founders realize.

3.     Create a micro-case study (even though no one has paid you yet). Frame it around the problem, what you showed them, and what resonated. You’re not claiming results, you’re demonstrating understanding, empathy, and a repeatable sales lens.

4.     Draft a clear list of your hypotheses and what you’ve validated so far. This shows you’re not guessing. It shows discipline. Most founders skip this step entirely, so it really stands out.

5.     Build a lightweight pilot-ready overview. Even if you’re not running pilots yet, outline what a pilot would look like, the goals, timeline, and what you’d measure. It signals maturity and foresight.

6.     Summarize your early learnings in a single, clean doc. This is the type of thing investors hold onto. It makes you look like a team that understands reality, not just theory.

7.     Outline your GTM approach in a one-pager. Not a 50-page plan, just the 20% that creates 80% of investor confidence: who you’re targeting, why, and how you’ll reach them.

8.     Prepare a simple, honest risk matrix (and how you’re mitigating each one). Founders rarely do this. Doing it screams, “We know the terrain and we’re thinking ahead.”

9.     Create a dashboard of the 5–7 metrics that matter before revenue. Pipeline depth, engagement, cycle time, product usage (if applicable), validation metrics, anything that gives you a heartbeat. It shows rigor.

10.  Identify your first 10 customers by name or profile. Again, this is about clarity. Investors want to know you’re not hunting in the dark.

11.  Founder bios plus why each of you cares about this problem A little story makes a startup feel real, especially pre-revenue.

12.  Investor FAQ plus Objection Handling Sheet. A simple doc where you pre-answer the 20-30 questions investors ask 100% of the time: competition, pricing, defensibility, TAM, team gaps, speed to market, revenue timing, etc. Shows you’re prepared, confident, and not thrown off by hard questions.

There are more strategic moves you can employ but the above are most of the top items I’ve seen hundreds of startups stumble on. None of this is about perfection. It’s about showing a level of clarity, preparedness, and operational thinking that 95% of founders never reach. And not because they’re not smart, they just haven’t been exposed to what “great” looks like on the investor side.

Everything above is designed to make an investor think, “Okay… these folks are way ahead of where most teams are at this stage.”

If you want, I can help you prioritize this list so you’re not adding more stress, just stacking wins. You’re doing something real here. This is just the extra layer that makes the right people lean in.

Talk soon,
Ed
