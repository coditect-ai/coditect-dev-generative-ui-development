# The Harsh Truth About Building a Startup in the AI Era

**A Conversation with Anish Acharya, Partner at Andreessen Horowitz**

*Podcast Interview Transcript — November 2025*

---

## Introduction

Every founder has that feeling: "Oh my god, I'm too late." And now it doesn't matter what we build because no one will fund it. But if you're able to put the blinders on and just turn that noise down for a moment, what you'll see is actually we're in the best time to build a startup we've ever been in.

It is objectively the fastest developing product cycle we've ever seen. You can do these incredible, extraordinary things that would have sounded like science fiction five years ago. But there's just so many places you can get stuck, and I'll tell you about some of the traps.

## Part 1: The A16Z Philosophy

**Interviewer:** Anish, it's great to see you. Thank you so much for your time. Welcome to the podcast. A16Z—wow, you guys are on fire right now.

**Anish Acharya:** We're working hard. We try to be everywhere, you know. And when there's more opportunity, that means—you know, Ben says there's no such thing as luck. We're not allowed to be lucky; we've just got to cover everything. So when there's more things to cover, we've just got to put in more cycles.

**Interviewer:** I kind of feel like A16Z is so well known in the ecosystem, but I don't think founders know well enough what actually happens inside Andreessen. Can you just give us an update? What's Andreessen all about? What are you guys focused on, and what's the lay of the land in startups?

**Anish Acharya:** You know, it's funny, because Andreessen is so well known, but the core thesis of the firm, I think, is less well known. I didn't know it when I joined in 2019.

The core thesis has always been that **founders make the best long-term CEOs and leaders of their companies**. And that sounds like a non-controversial statement, but 10 years ago when the firm started—15 years ago—it was actually controversial. Common practice at the time was that venture firms would bring in a so-called "professional experienced CEO."

Now, what is the difference between a founder and a CEO? It tends to be two things: **knowledge and networks**. So the whole structure of the firm is meant to help founders be those CEOs of their companies forever by pulling networks and knowledge around them. That's the core thesis.

In terms of the way the firm is composed—it is a big firm, but everybody's a specialist. The expectation is that we're all very, very deep and kind of obsessed and technical and operational and networked in our areas. And because so many interesting things in software cut across many areas, we're able to come together and bring a better proposition to the founder than you would get from a smaller team of pure generalists.

## Part 2: The 1,000 Days of AI

**Interviewer:** This whole AI landscape has been changing so quickly. Before we came on the show, we said November 30th this year, it's going to be three years since GPT—a thousand days. What the hell is happening in AI right now? Can you help us break down what's happening? It just seems to be changing every freaking day.

**Anish Acharya:** This product cycle is different. If you think back to the mobile product cycle, it sort of was all downstream of Apple. Apple did the iPhone in 2008, they did the App Store in 2009. 

This was a surprising fact to me, but when the App Store came out in 2009, there were only 6 million iPhones in distribution. So one year post-iPhone, your TAM as a mobile app developer was 6 million customers.

Today, if you build into the Apps SDK—which is the new AI App Store that ChatGPT is going to be releasing—you've got an audience of **850 million people**. The scale is enormous.

But the other interesting thing is when we were building an app in the App Store in 2009, 2010, Apple decided what APIs they would expose, and all of the developers would organize around those APIs. Whereas with large models, it's more of a process of biology than systems design. The models are being trained, we're discovering what the models can do, and they have all of these emergent properties.

For that reason, there's a much wider diffusion of things that are being built, things that can be built, because no central decider is upstream of the entire innovation ecosystem. It's really crazy. It's so exciting.

## Part 3: The Psychology of Founding

**Interviewer:** Is it tough to be a founder right now in this highly competitive AI landscape if you're raising 10, 15 million pre-seed rounds?

**Anish Acharya:** The whole trick of being a founder—much of the trick—is an exercise in psychology, personal psychology. There's just so many places that you can get stuck.

### The Three Traps

**Trap #1: "I'm Too Late"**

Every founder has that feeling like, "Oh, I should have started my company a year ago, a month ago, and if I had, I'd be where XYZ is." That's a very common trap.

**Trap #2: "Nobody is Funding Anyone"**

Another common one is, "We're in a winter. Oh my god, even if I built something, nobody will pay attention." 

When I was building my first startup in 2009, I remember the TechCrunch article well—the headline was "The End of Venture Capital." I sent it to my co-founder and said, "It's over. Venture capital's over. TechCrunch has said so, and it doesn't matter what we build because no one will fund it."

**Trap #3: Looking at Competition**

You can look around and feel like, "Oh my god, look at how much everyone else is raising from all these credible folks."

### The Reality

But if you're able to put the blinders on and just turn that noise down for a moment and look at where we are from first principles, what you'll see is actually we're in kind of **the best time to build a startup we've ever been in**—that I've ever seen, for sure.

Let's say you're building in consumer. What is the nature of consumer product today? Consumers are incredibly excited about AI, despite what you read in the newspaper. Millions and millions of users are downloading consumer AI products organically—so there's no paid acquisition necessary.

With these large models, you can do these incredible, extraordinary things that would have sounded like science fiction five years ago. And the model companies are beating each other's brains out to spend more to improve the models, which really benefits all the founders and builders. We just saw that with Gemini 3, which looks extraordinary and was released yesterday.

From a first principles perspective, there's never been more opportunity, even though there's never been more noise.

## Part 4: These Are Industries, Not Markets

**Interviewer:** So many founders are saying, "I'm too late. They want to sort of build a legal tech platform or a vibe coding platform." But how many vibe coding tools do we need? Are these founders going to create really interesting products that are highly specialized and highly verticalized?

**Anish Acharya:** I'll tell you the mistake that I have consistently made, and I feel like I continue to make it in this AI ecosystem: **underestimating how big these markets are**.

That's why I describe it this way: **these are not markets, they're industries**.

AI code is not a market with a single winner or even a half dozen winners. It's going to be an industry with 30, 40, 50 winners.

Legal AI is going to be as significant as simply "legal." It's like we used to say "e-business," but it's really just business. When we say "AI legal," we really just mean legal. And I think it's going to be enormous.

Yes, there's going to be specialization, but the size of those specialized markets are going to be as big as entire software markets were previously.

**It's definitely not too late**, and I think the one mistake I would encourage folks not to make is underestimating the size and significance of the opportunity.

## Part 5: AI is Automating Tasks, Not Replacing Jobs

**Interviewer:** Potentially AI is going to start replacing jobs. What do you think is going to happen in the next thousand days?

**Anish Acharya:** I have to quibble with the framing of "AI is going to start replacing jobs" because we're out on the front line talking to all of these AI companies that are selling enterprise software.

What we don't hear very often is that it fully replaces a job. What we do hear is that it **fully automates a task**—but tasks are not jobs.

What we've typically seen with these enterprise software companies—even ones that when you squint from afar and say, "Wow, the AI is answering the phone and doing a lot of negotiation, maybe that's going to replace a job"—what we actually see is that it gives the people doing the job a lot of leverage.

They no longer have to do the administrative, rote parts of the job. They're able to specialize. Perhaps those folks are spending less time than they previously spent overall working, but we're not seeing role elimination broadly.

**AI is automating tasks.** A thousand days will be extraordinary in terms of model capability improvement, but I don't know that we're going to suddenly see some sort of runaway dystopian effects from the models. I think we're just going to see more of what we've already seen.

### The Happy Robot Example

One of our best companies, Happy Robot, sells voice AI to freight brokers. What they've actually seen is that a lot of the folks who were previously doing low-level customer support work are now moved into customer relationship management.

The AI is never going to take a key customer account out for a steak dinner. Somebody's still got to do that. But if people are too busy handling the day-to-day minutia, they have less time for relationships.

Instead, we're seeing **humans get to be more human than ever**, and AI takes away a lot of the work that really didn't get leverage from human skills anyway.

## Part 6: Consumer Tech is Back

**Interviewer:** People have said nothing's happened in consumer tech for the last five or 10 years—it's boring. But now it kind of feels consumer tech is coming back, but it's AI-focused. What's happening?

**Anish Acharya:** Consumer is hyper-cyclical. For long periods of time, nothing happens and it's a very tough time to invest or build in the consumer ecosystem. And then you have these magical moments where the window opens up, and all of a sudden you can build consumer tech and consumers change. Something is in the water. New products are being launched, the boundary of imagination is being pushed.

Born from those moments in time are some of the biggest companies in the world. If you look at Mag 7, the majority of those companies are consumer companies or have a significant consumer offering. If you look at what happened post-iPhone—2011, 2012—we suddenly had this explosion of Lyft, Uber, WhatsApp, Airbnb. It was extraordinary.

**We're in that moment again.**

### Three Things That Unlock Consumer Markets

1. **New Technology** — Which we of course have in AI

2. **New Consumer Behaviors** — Connected to new technology, but people are just making different choices. In the mobile era, I remember people saying, "Location is too sensitive. No one will ever share their location." And now every Gen Z shares their location with all their friends and their exes. Consumer choices and preferences just change very quickly.

3. **New Distribution Channel** — If there was a critique of consumer tech at this moment, it's that we don't really have an AI-native distribution channel. I think that's about to change in 2026.

---

## Part 7: Product Problems, Not Marketing Problems

**Anish Acharya:** As a consumer founder, you have to ask yourself: how am I going to spend every day? 

I think as a consumer founder from 2014 to 2023, the way you probably spent your day was marketing. And very few of us are people that get joy from consumer product marketing and customer acquisition.

Whereas if you look at how you spend your day today as a consumer founder, you're spending it building product.

**I would argue that there are no marketing problems today for consumer companies—there are only product problems.** And if you're not getting distribution, you probably haven't been ambitious enough in product.

This is a really fun and magical time. Business model quality is high, consumers are willing to pay, they want to try new things, and you have so much to work with as a consumer founder.

### Consumers Are Willing to Pay

If you look at Gemini Ultra, Google Ultra—that's $250 a month. ChatGPT's top SKU is $200. GCK Heavy is $300. People are paying it.

The other cool thing is for the first time ever, you've got **consumption revenue for consumers**. Typically in the past, a consumer could subscribe to a product, but you're never going to pay Spotify $100 in a given month. If you pay $20 a month in subscription, there wasn't a way—if you listen to 5X more music—for you to pay them $100 in a given month.

Whereas now, if you're using a creative tool like Krea, a coding tool like Cursor, you can conceptually pay that company a lot more than the fixed subscription rate. That's a new business model improvement for consumer founders.

## Part 8: 2026 Distribution Channels

**Interviewer:** You mentioned earlier this new distribution model. What does that look like for new consumer AI companies coming to market?

**Anish Acharya:** This is such a great topic. This is the one thing we've all looked for. In 2005, 2006, it was the Facebook social APIs plus access to Facebook notifications as a channel. In 2009, it was the App Store.

Now we actually have this moment. I think in 2026 we're going to see something similar.

### Three Channels to Watch

**1. Apps SDK**
Announced 30-45 days ago by OpenAI. You can embed experiences within ChatGPT and get distribution. They're going to have discovery and an App Store—some sort of App Store.

**2. Mini Apps**
Wabi was ahead on mini apps, and I didn't expect Apple to fully embrace it, but they have. They announced they're going to support a mini apps ecosystem. Importantly, they've reduced their take rate for mini apps from 30% to 15%. That's a pretty cool economic benefit.

**3. Group Chats**
We saw a bunch of hubbub around group chat in ChatGPT. They're launching initially in New Zealand and a bunch of other countries. It's of course going to come to North America. I suspect OpenAI will have app discovery and consumption within group chats, and then Meta and others will be forced to replicate that.

As a consumer founder, you've got these three channels—AI Apps SDK, mini apps, and group chats—which could be really, really big. **2026 is going to be a foot race.** It's not for the faint of heart, but the consequences should be multiple consumer companies with a hundred million users when we have this conversation next year.

## Part 9: Voice is an Industry Change

**Interviewer:** Voice is now becoming potentially the new interface for productivity. What's happening in voice and why is now so exciting?

**Anish Acharya:** We've been obsessed with voice and covering it really closely for the last few years. Part of it started from a dreamy vision—I don't know if you've read *Ender's Game*, but they've got a voice assistant named Jane. Of course, *Her* has been discussed to death. We've had these fantastical imaginations of a voice interface, but we've just never had the technology to make it happen.

As I said for AI code and legal tech, we under-predicted how important and how big it was going to be.

**Voice is not a market. Voice is not a primitive. Voice is an industry change.**

What's happening with voice is that it's turning out to be **the insertion point for AI into the enterprise** because it's something the enterprise already does. Every enterprise in the world has phone calls and voice.

There's two parts of voice:
- **Scribes** — Note-taking broadly
- **Phone calls and agents**

It's turned out so far that the agents have worked better and at higher scale than the scribes. The scribes are also very interesting and important, but it's just turning out to be a lot bigger than any of us expected.

**I think there's going to be hundreds of companies that get to scale in verticals with voice as their wedge.**

## Part 10: The AI Wrapper Concern

**Interviewer:** These AI models provide APIs to startups. They have full visibility on what these companies are doing, how well they're doing. And all of a sudden, two months later, they launch their own version. It wipes out all the companies. Are we going to see more of this? Is it fair?

**Anish Acharya:** I don't worry at all about the AI wrapper conversation. Let me give you a couple of reasons why.

### Why Startups Have the Advantage

**Multi-Model Access**

There are parts of the market where you're at a huge advantage being a startup. An important part of the market is any category where the customer gets a better experience when they use multi-model instead of single-model.

If you're OpenAI, you're only ever going to be able to ship products with OpenAI models. If you're Google, you're only going to ship with Google models. But if you look at a product like Cursor or Krea, these are products where you really want access to every model and every model provider—and definitionally, the labs and big tech are not going to be able to do that.

**Models Are Not Products**

Models can do things that start to hint at products, but they're not products. If you're building a product that is directly overlapping with something the labs do today, then sure, maybe there's some risk. But if you look at something like Cursor, they've had tremendous success despite from afar saying, "Hey, that's something an Anthropic or OpenAI might replicate."

**Different Incentive Structures**

I always joke that company priorities get set in promo committee for big tech. If you're at Google and you're thinking as a PM, "How do I get promoted?"—the way you get promoted is not by launching some wildly creative, risky new product. You don't say, "I'm going to create this grumpy, personality-driven interface to email." That sounds very risky.

You say, "No, no, no, I'm going to add AI-generated email drafts to Gmail." That feels good and safe.

**The direction of ambition you're incentivized to have at big tech is really different.** Whereas when you're a founder, you're like, "Look, I need to distinguish myself. I want to do something crazy. Nobody is here to tell me no."

That's how you end up with a product like Poke—not by being a PM at Google or Facebook.

---

## Part 11: The Future of Social Networks

**Interviewer:** We haven't seen any new social media platforms really emerge in the last five or six years. Is AI going to change that?

**Anish Acharya:** We're so trained to look at the last cycle and assume that what success looks like in the next cycle will be similar. Everybody's looking for the next-gen Instagram to look like the last-gen Instagram. I think it'll be totally different.

When I look at a product like Wabi, I say, "Maybe that's what the next AI-native network looks like." Something where the status game is focused on people making the coolest, most interesting software instead of the coolest, most interesting content.

**What is a media format that's native to the new technology?** Video, photograph—all this other stuff is native to mobile. But the AI-native social network won't be based around media from the last generation. The media of the new generation is things like models, things like software.

I do think there's space for a new social product, a new network broadly. I just think it's going to look so different. It's not going to be Instagram++. It sort of definitionally can't be, because Instagram is going to build that.

The critique of a lot of AI so far has been there's been a lot of tools, not a lot of networks. But to your point about a thousand days—where are we if we overlay where we are today in comparison to mobile? **We're in 2011.** 2011 was really before Airbnb, Uber, WhatsApp—everything got to scale. It's still very, very early days.

## Part 12: Fundraising Principles

**Interviewer:** How should founders be thinking about fundraising today? Should they focus on raising as much as they can, or be focused on raising realistic rounds?

**Anish Acharya:** It's such a complicated question. If you think back to first principles: why is it not optimal for founders to raise all the money they need in the lifetime of a company on day zero?

If you're a founder and you're going to raise $5 million, then $20 million, then $50 million—why don't you just raise $125 million on day zero?

### The Discipline of Right-Sized Rounds

The reason that doesn't work well is actually interesting. It's not because you can't get $125 million. It's because what happens when founders have too much money—and I've been through this myself—is you typically take your scarce resource, which is not money but talent, and you spread it across too many efforts.

What you really need is **concentration of talent and focus on just one thing at a given time**. And raising the right amount of money drives that concentration.

Everybody thinks—I thought it myself when I was a founder—"Hey, I won't get distracted, I'll prioritize." But you just don't. It's hard not to do many things at once.

### The Current Moment

The magic right now is that you can **lead with product instead of marketing dollars**.

The world we were in in 2021—where you had to raise $100 million to spend $100 million on Google and Facebook—that world doesn't exist anymore. If you have to raise $100 million to train a better model or build a better product, great. Because that's exactly the kind of risk capital that investors want to invest and founders want to raise.

**The brass tacks: raise for 24 months at the best terms you can, but not such a high price that it makes the next round difficult.**

### The Two-Week Sprint

**Interviewer:** When founders are thinking about how to run a super smooth fundraising process—is the best approach to just focus two weeks, meet as many VCs as you can, get as many term sheets? Or is it a bit scattered over a month?

**Anish Acharya:** I think it's two things.

First, over the course of time, building relationships. I always say: **when you need trust, it's too late to build it.** Having met people you might want to raise from at least once, maybe having had coffee once a quarter over the course of a year, is not a bad idea.

Then, when you're ready to fundraise, you should plan to get nothing else done for two weeks. Just put your head down. Go do the work. Go talk to all the folks you already have relationships with.

**If you're getting a lukewarm reception in the first two or three meetings, that's a very, very important signal.** There might be some more work to do.

I think the most useful thing an investor can do, other than giving you money, is just giving you the real talk. Sometimes you've got to torture the investors a little bit—especially if they haven't been a founder themselves. If they have, they often know: "Look, I can't give you the money, but let me tell you what's up. Let me tell you that you've got gum on your shoe, so you can take that off and let's have another conversation in three months."

## Closing Thoughts

**Interviewer:** You've seen and met many founders, and you've probably got so many cool ideas. What would you build right now?

**Anish Acharya:** The one thing I would not do is go work at big tech or at scale. Because it just feels like **right now is the moment to be at the edge**.

Maybe there are teams within big tech that are really exciting and at the edge—that's the exception. But I just feel like you want to be working on the most important thing, the thing you can contribute the most to. For me, that would be being a founder or working at the edge, either within big tech or one of the most important labs.

**The area I'm personally spending the most energy on is AI code.** I'm so fired up, mostly because I've always been an engineer—but a mediocre one. And now I'm a less mediocre one, thanks to the tools and the models.

So I'd probably be dreaming of building in something like that.

---

**Interviewer:** This has been so much fun—packed with insights, so much information. Thank you so much for your time. Let's come back in 12 months and see just how far AI has progressed.

**Anish Acharya:** It's not 12 months—it's another 365 days, right? Thank you for having me. Thanks for providing the platform, and I'm excited for our next conversation.
