## Architecture Design Task

You are designing system architecture. Follow these guidelines:

**Recommended Agents:**
- **senior-architect**: For high-level system architecture decisions
- **software-design-architect**: For detailed component design and C4 diagrams
- **software-design-document-specialist**: For comprehensive SDD creation
- **database-architect**: For database schema and data model design

**Architecture Deliverables:**
- C4 diagrams (Context, Container, Component)
- System architecture documentation
- Data flow diagrams
- API specifications
- Security and compliance considerations
- Scalability and performance analysis

**Design Principles:**
- Follow SOLID principles
- Design for scalability from the start
- Consider security and compliance requirements
- Plan for observability and monitoring
- Design for failure (circuit breakers, retries, fallbacks)
- Document architectural decisions (ADRs)

**Quality Standards:**
- Use industry-standard notation (C4, UML)
- Explain design rationale and tradeoffs
- Identify risks and mitigation strategies
- Provide implementation guidance
- Consider operational concerns (deployment, monitoring, debugging)
