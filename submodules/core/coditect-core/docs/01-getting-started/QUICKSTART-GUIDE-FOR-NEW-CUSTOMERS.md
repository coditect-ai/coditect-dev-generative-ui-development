# CODITECT Quick Start Guide for New Customers

Welcome to CODITECT! This guide will help you prepare for your first project and understand what to expect as you transform your idea into a production-ready product.

## Before You Begin: Gather Your Documents

The more information you provide upfront, the better CODITECT can help you. Place any existing documents in your project's `original-documents/` folder. Don't worry if you don't have everything—CODITECT will help you create what's missing.

### 📁 Recommended Documents to Bring

**If you have an existing business idea or product:**

**Business & Market Information:**
- Business plan or executive summary
- Market research or industry reports
- Competitor analysis or competitive landscape notes
- Customer interviews, surveys, or feedback
- Pricing research or benchmarks
- Target customer descriptions or personas

**Product Information:**
- Product vision or concept document
- Feature lists or requirements
- User stories or use cases
- Wireframes, mockups, or design files
- Brand guidelines or style guides

**Technical Information:**
- Existing architecture diagrams or technical docs
- Database schemas or data models
- API documentation
- Technology stack decisions or preferences
- Integration requirements
- Security or compliance requirements

**Project & Business Context:**
- Project goals and success metrics
- Budget constraints or estimates
- Timeline expectations or deadlines
- Team structure and roles
- Stakeholder requirements
- Risk concerns or known challenges

**Don't have documents yet?** That's perfectly fine! CODITECT will guide you through creating everything from scratch. Even rough notes, emails, or slide decks are helpful starting points.

## What CODITECT Will Help You Create

Based on your input and through guided conversations, CODITECT will help you develop a complete project foundation organized into three phases:

### Phase 1: Business Discovery

**Understanding Your Market & Customers**

CODITECT will help you create documents that answer critical business questions:

- **Market Research** - How big is the opportunity? Who are your competitors? What are the trends?
- **Value Proposition** - What problem are you solving? Why will customers choose you?
- **Customer Profile** - Who exactly is your ideal customer? What do they need?

These documents ensure you're building something the market actually wants.

### Phase 2: Strategic Planning

**Validating Your Approach**

CODITECT will help you validate and plan your go-to-market strategy:

- **Product-Market Fit** - Does your solution match a real market need?
- **Competitive Analysis** - How do you compare to alternatives? What makes you different?
- **Go-to-Market Strategy** - How will you reach and acquire customers?
- **Pricing Strategy** - What should you charge? What's the right pricing model?

These documents give you confidence that your business model makes sense.

### Phase 3: Technical Specification

**Designing Your Solution**

CODITECT will help you define exactly what to build:

- **System Architecture** - What's the overall technical design? What technologies will you use?
- **Database Schema** - How will you organize and store data?
- **API Specification** - How will different parts of your system communicate?
- **Software Design** - What features will you build? How will they work?
- **Architecture Decisions** - Why did you choose specific technologies or approaches?

These documents give your development team clear blueprints to follow.

### Phase 4: Project Management

**Planning Execution**

CODITECT will help you create actionable plans:

- **Project Plan** - What are the phases? What resources do you need? What are the risks?
- **Task List** - What specific tasks need to be done? In what order? What's the priority?

These documents turn your vision into a concrete roadmap.

## How CODITECT Works

### The Starting Prompt

When you're ready to begin, you'll provide CODITECT with a simple description:

```
I'm starting a new project called [YOUR PROJECT NAME].

The project is about: [1-2 sentence description of what you're building and who it's for]

I need help creating a complete project foundation with:
1. Business discovery documents (market research, value proposition, competitive analysis)
2. Technical specification (system architecture, database schema, API design)
3. Project management framework (project plan and task list)

Please guide me through the process step by step.
I'm new to CODITECT, so please explain what we're doing at each stage.
```

### What Happens Next

1. **CODITECT Analyzes Your Input** - Any documents you've provided plus your project description
2. **Guided Conversation** - CODITECT asks clarifying questions to understand your vision
3. **Document Generation** - CODITECT creates professional documents based on your answers
4. **Review & Refine** - You review each document and request changes until it's right
5. **Progress Checkpoints** - Your work is automatically saved at major milestones
6. **Complete Foundation** - You end up with 15-18 professional documents ready for development

## What Makes a Good Starting Point

### Clear Project Description

**Good Example:**
"We're building a project management tool for small creative agencies (5-20 people). These agencies currently use 10+ separate tools which is expensive and inefficient. Our platform combines project tracking, client communication, file sharing, and time tracking in one place. We'll use a freemium model with paid plans starting at $49/month."

**Why it's good:** Specific target customer, clear problem, defined solution, business model mentioned.

**Less Helpful Example:**
"We want to build a SaaS platform."

**Why it's less helpful:** Too vague—no indication of who it's for, what problem it solves, or how it works.

### Known Constraints or Requirements

It's helpful to mention upfront:
- Budget constraints ("bootstrap budget under $50K")
- Timeline needs ("must launch before Q4")
- Technical requirements ("must integrate with Salesforce")
- Compliance needs ("must be HIPAA compliant")
- Team constraints ("solo founder, need to outsource development")

### What You Don't Need

You **do not** need:
- Technical expertise or coding knowledge
- Perfect clarity on every detail
- Completed market research
- Finalized feature lists
- Existing technical documentation

CODITECT is designed to help you figure all of this out through structured guidance.
