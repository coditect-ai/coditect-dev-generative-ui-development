### Step 2.4: Technical Architecture (C4 Model) 🏗️

**Goal**: Design a scalable, maintainable system using the C4 Model methodology

#### C4 Model Overview

The C4 Model provides **4 levels of architectural abstraction**:

1. **C1: System Context** - The big picture (stakeholder view)
2. **C2: Container** - High-level technology choices (architect view)
3. **C3: Component** - Component breakdown (developer view)
4. **C4: Code** - Implementation details (code view)

**See**: `C4-ARCHITECTURE-METHODOLOGY.md` for complete documentation

#### C1: System Context Diagram

**Create this FIRST** - shows how your system fits into the world

- [ ] Identify all user types (personas)
- [ ] Map external systems (APIs, databases, services)
- [ ] Show data flows and integrations
- [ ] Use Mermaid C4 syntax

**Template**:
```mermaid
C4Context
    title System Context - [Your Product Name]

    Person(user, "User Type", "Description")
    System(yourSystem, "[Your Product]", "What it does")
    System_Ext(externalAPI, "External System", "Purpose")

    Rel(user, yourSystem, "Uses", "HTTPS")
    Rel(yourSystem, externalAPI, "Integrates with", "REST API")
```

**Output**: `c1-system-context.mmd` in `/docs/architecture/diagrams/`

#### C2: Container Diagram

**Create SECOND** - shows major technical components

- [ ] Web applications (React, Vue, etc.)
- [ ] Mobile apps (iOS, Android)
- [ ] API servers (Node.js, Python, Go)
- [ ] Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- [ ] Caches (Redis, Memcached)
- [ ] Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)

**Template**:
```mermaid
C4Container
    title Container Diagram - [Your Product Name]

    Container(webApp, "Web App", "React", "User interface")
    Container(api, "API", "Node.js", "Business logic")
    ContainerDb(db, "Database", "PostgreSQL", "Data storage")

    Rel(webApp, api, "Calls", "HTTPS/REST")
    Rel(api, db, "Reads/Writes", "SQL")
```

**Output**: `c2-container.mmd` in `/docs/architecture/diagrams/`

#### C3: Component Diagrams

**Create for EACH container** - shows internal components

- [ ] Break down frontend into components
- [ ] Break down API into services
- [ ] Show data flow between components
- [ ] Document interfaces

**Output**: `c3-component-[container-name].mmd` for each container

#### C4: Code Diagrams

**Create for COMPLEX components** - shows class structure

- [ ] Use UML class diagrams
- [ ] Show inheritance relationships
- [ ] Document key interfaces
- [ ] Guide implementation

**Output**: `c4-code-[component-name].mmd` for complex components

#### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

For EVERY major technical decision, create an ADR:

**Template**: `ADR-###-[short-title].md`

```markdown
# ADR-001: [Decision Title]

**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Decision Makers**: [Names]

## Context
What is the issue we're addressing?

## Decision
What are we doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or harder as a result?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options did we evaluate?
```

**Required ADRs for all projects**:
- [ ] ADR-001: Tech stack selection
- [ ] ADR-002: Database choice
- [ ] ADR-003: Deployment architecture
- [ ] ADR-004: Authentication & authorization
- [ ] ADR-005: Monitoring & observability
- [ ] ADR-006: CI/CD pipeline

**Output**: `/docs/architecture/adrs/` directory

#### System Design Documents

- [ ] **High-level architecture diagram** (Mermaid)
- [ ] **Data flow diagrams** (Mermaid)
- [ ] **Database schema** (ER diagram)
- [ ] **API specifications** (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform/CDK)

**Output**: `09-system-design.md` with diagrams in `/docs/architecture/`

## Questions & Support

### Common Questions

**Q: How long does this process take?**
A: For a typical SaaS MVP:
- Discovery & Validation: 2-3 weeks
- Strategy & Planning: 1-2 weeks
- Execution (MVP): 8-12 weeks
- Total: ~3-4 months

**Q: Can I skip steps?**
A: You can, but each step exists because teams that skip it usually fail. The order matters.

**Q: What if I'm a solo founder?**
A: Follow the same process, but move faster. Focus on "good enough" over "perfect" for early stages.

**Q: How do I know if I have product-market fit?**
A: Key signals:
- Customers are pulling (not you pushing)
- Retention is strong (>90% monthly for B2B)
- Word-of-mouth referrals happening
- Willingness to pay is high

**Q: When should I start charging?**
A: Charge from day 1 if possible. Free users don't give accurate demand signals.
