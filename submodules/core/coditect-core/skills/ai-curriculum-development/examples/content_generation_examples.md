# AI Curriculum Development - Usage Examples

## Example 1: Complete Module Generation

### Context
Generate comprehensive content for Module 3: Deep Learning across all skill levels.

### Usage
```
When working on deep learning curriculum development, I need to create content that scales from absolute beginners to research experts. Use ai-curriculum-development skill to generate Week 9 neural network fundamentals.
```

### Expected Output
- Beginner content with brain analogies and visual explanations
- Intermediate content with NumPy implementation projects  
- Advanced content with research paper analysis and optimization
- Expert content with theoretical foundations and innovation challenges
- Complete assessment framework with adaptive quizzes and projects
- NotebookLM-optimized metadata and cross-references

## Example 2: Assessment-Integrated Learning Design

### Context
Create learning experience that seamlessly integrates formative and summative assessment.

### Usage
```
I need to develop machine learning content where assessment drives learning. Use ai-curriculum-development skill to create assessment-integrated content for supervised learning concepts.
```

### Expected Features
- Embedded knowledge checks every few paragraphs
- Progressive project checkpoints with validation
- Skill-level appropriate evaluation methods
- Portfolio building opportunities
- Peer review and collaboration frameworks

## Example 3: Cross-Level Content Adaptation

### Context
Transform expert-level research content into accessible beginner material while preserving core concepts.

### Usage
```
Take the transformer architecture research and adapt it across all skill levels using ai-curriculum-development skill, maintaining conceptual integrity while adjusting complexity.
```

### Adaptation Strategy
- **Expert**: Full mathematical derivations and research context
- **Advanced**: Algorithmic implementation with performance analysis
- **Intermediate**: Practical usage with popular libraries  
- **Beginner**: High-level concepts with everyday analogies

## Example 4: NotebookLM Content Optimization

### Context
